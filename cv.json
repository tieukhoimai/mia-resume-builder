  "headline": "I hold an M.Sc. in Data Science from University of Verona, with international experience through an academic exchange at the University of Oslo and a six-month research internship at SINTEF Digital. At SINTEF, I contributed to the design and implementation of multi-agent architectures for manufacturing Digital Twin systems. Previously, I spent four years working as a Data Analyst/Engineer in Vietnam on large-scale IoT products, including ADAS radar systems at Bosch and WearOS smartwatch platforms at Fossil Group. My experience spans analytics engineering, BI tools, CI/CD pipelines, and cloud deployment on GCP and AWS. I am particularly interested in Data Science roles focused on IoT-enabled and sensor-driven systems.",
