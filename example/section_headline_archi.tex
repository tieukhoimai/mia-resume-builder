    I hold an M.Sc. in Data Science from the University of Verona, with international experience through an Erasmus exchange at the University of Oslo and a six-month research internship at SINTEF Digital.
    At SINTEF, I contributed to the design and implementation of multi-agent architectures for manufacturing Digital Twin systems.
    Previously, I spent four years working as a Data Analyst/Engineer in Vietnam on large-scale IoT products, including ADAS radar systems at Bosch and WearOS smartwatch platforms at Fossil Group.
    I have hands-on experience with analytics engineering, BI tools, CI/CD pipelines, and cloud deployment on GCP and AWS.
