	Four years’ experience across analytics engineering and AI research, delivering intelligent monitoring and multi-agent systems for IoT/Digital Twins. Comfortable with LLM and agent frameworks, CI/CD, and low-latency services — backed by theory and statistically validated evaluation. I enjoy building end-to-end systems from data collection and modeling to monitoring and explainable dashboards.
